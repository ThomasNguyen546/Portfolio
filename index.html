            <p class="paragraph1">I'm a recent University of Utah, David Eccles School of Business graduate. I graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelor's of Science in Finance.
                I have worked in the customer service industry, as well as the financial services industry for years now. I am currently employed as an Associate Banker at
                JP Morgan Chase and Co. I am currently pursuing a certificate at the University of Utah to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph2">During my time at the University of Utah I had the opportunity to be a part of the very first varsity eSports program. The program was split into four various
                games. I was part of the League of Legends team, where I was fortunate enough to play varsity all four years of my college education while earning scholarship from the program. While on the team I was 
                able to establish and gain experience working in a team environment. It was crucial to be able to work in a team environment, due to the fact that we were competing
                against hundreds of colleges throughout the nation every year. I was also able to develop my leadership skills through being a part of the team.
